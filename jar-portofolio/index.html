                    <p>The influence of digital media makes people aware of the importance of the role of a website. Without a website, distant customers won't know what products you sell, what services you offer, what information you deliver. But with the website, you and your customers will still be connected even with a long distance. The website can be accessed using only the phone that you always use every day. That way, customers don't need to bother visiting your store.
